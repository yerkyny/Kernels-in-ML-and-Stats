# Kernels-in-ML-and-Stats
This is my semester project on Kernel methods in Machine learning and Statistics that I did in the Fall semester of 2022 during the first year of my Master at EPFL. The machine learning part focuses on retelling the mathematical grounds of several linear methods and their kernel version, including geometric motivation, optimization in finite dimensional space and RKHS and illustrating experiments. The statistical part summarizes the works of Gretton et al. on kernel two-sample and independence testing based on MMD and HSIC and provides simulations with comparison of the kernel-based and traditional tests for independence.
